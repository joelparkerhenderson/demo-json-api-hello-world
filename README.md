JSON API is a convention for response formatting.

JSON API conventions help you increase productivity,
take advantage of tooling, and focus on your application.

Clients built around JSON API are able to take advantage
of its features around efficiently caching responses,
and even sometimes eliminating network requests entirely.

JSON API has been properly registered with the IANA.
Its media type designation is application/vnd.api+json.

This repository contains just one JSON file,
that contains just one line of JSON meta information,
that says "Hello World".
